\noindent \fontsize{12}{12}\textbf{1.2 MOTIVATION}
%\pagenumbering{arabic}
\justify      
\hspace{5mm} In today's fast-paced and ever-evolving world, the way we consume information has drastically changed. People are inundated with vast amounts of data every day, and attention spans are dwindling. This project is motivated by the recognition that traditional methods of presenting information, especially government press releases, may not effectively capture the attention of the modern audience. There is a pressing need to adapt to this changing landscape, ensuring that important information from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) reaches the public in a way that is not only informative but also engaging.\\

The motivation behind developing this comprehensive software solution lies in the belief that the power of technology can be harnessed to bridge the gap between the conventional and the contemporary. By seamlessly translating text-based press releases into visually captivating video content, the project aims to make government communication more accessible and appealing. This endeavor recognizes the importance of meeting the audience where they are – in the realm of dynamic multimedia content that holds the potential to resonate with diverse demographics.
   
\bigskip

\noindent \fontsize{12}{12} \textbf{1.3 PROBLEM DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES}
\justify
\hspace{5mm} The current Press Releases disseminated by the Press Information Bureau (PIB) are predominantly presented in a text-based format. However, the evolving media landscape and diminishing user attention spans demand a more engaging and effective approach to information dissemination. To address this challenge, the primary objective is to develop specialized software capable of automatically converting the existing Press Releases into compelling video content.\\

This software should possess the ability to seamlessly transform textual content into video format, enhancing the engagement and accessibility of the information. It should use images and clips from a pool of copyright-free images, clips, and videos.\\

A crucial feature of the software should be the establishment of a media repository, which stores a diverse pool of images and video clips for potential use in video creation. Before publication, the generated video content should undergo a thorough vetting process by designated PIB officers to maintain accuracy and appropriateness.
\\
To streamline the approval process, the software must include a notification system that promptly informs the relevant PIB officer when a video is ready for review and approval. Finally, upon approval, the software should be equipped with the capability to automatically upload the generated video content to specified social media platforms, ensuring efficient and widespread dissemination of PIB's information and updates.\\

In essence, the challenge at hand is to design a comprehensive software solution that not only automates the conversion of Press Releases into engaging videos but also guarantees adherence to copyright and authenticity standards, facilitates an efficient approval workflow, and integrates seamlessly with social media for effective communication.


\noindent  
\pagebreak


\noindent \fontsize{12}{12} \textbf{1.4 PROJECT SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS}
\justify
\hspace{5mm} The project aims to develop an automated software solution to convert text-based Press Releases from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) into engaging video formats, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text summarization and keyword extraction. The software will leverage copyright-free images and clips to create visually appealing videos, addressing the challenge of holding user attention in the face of shrinking attention spans. By transforming the way information is conveyed, the project seeks to foster more meaningful engagement with users and enhance the effectiveness of PIB's communication strategies.\\


However, several limitations need to be considered. The voiceover generated by the DeepGram API struggles with non-English words, potentially affecting the quality of the audio in the videos. Similarly, subtitling may also encounter difficulties with non-English words, which could impact the accessibility of the content. Additionally, while having a database of proprietary images would be beneficial, infrastructure costs may limit the usage of more advanced and resource-intensive models for text summarization, keyword extraction, and video generation. Despite these limitations, the project aims to utilize available resources effectively and explore alternative solutions to deliver engaging video content from Press Releases.\\


In addition to the limitations mentioned, another challenge is the availability and quality of copyright-free images and clips. While utilizing these resources is cost-effective, there may be limitations in finding relevant and high-quality visual content to enhance the videos. Moreover, the use of proprietary models, although potentially providing better results, may also pose challenges in terms of integration, scalability, and cost. Balancing these factors will be crucial in ensuring the success and sustainability of the automated software solution. Despite these challenges, the project aims to leverage available technologies and resources effectively to create engaging video content from Press Releases, ultimately improving the dissemination of information and enhancing user engagement with PIB's communications.

\noindent \fontsize{12}{12} \textbf{1.5 METHODOLOGIES OF PROBLEM SOLVING}
\justify
\hspace{5mm} \textbf{Text Summarization}: This module is crucial for condensing lengthy press releases into concise and informative summaries, forming the basis for video scripts. It involves implementing text summarization algorithms, possibly based on transformer models, to generate shorter yet comprehensive representations of press release content. These summaries will help in creating engaging video content by providing a clear and concise narrative.\\

\textbf{Keyword Extraction}: This module complements text summarization by identifying key terms and phrases that capture the essence of the press releases. These keywords are essential for content organization and matching with appropriate visual content. The software will automatically extract relevant keywords from press releases, aiding in the selection of images and clips for video creation.\\

\textbf{Database Generation}: This module involves building a database of copyright-free images, clips, and videos. This database serves as a foundational step for the project, providing a source for visuals used in video generation. The software will have access to a diverse and well-organized media repository, ensuring that content creators have a wide range of visuals to choose from when generating press release videos.\\

\textbf{Image Captioning}: Image captioning is crucial for generating textual descriptions of images and clips used in the video content. This ensures that the video remains informative even without audio narration. The software will provide meaningful captions for images and clips, enhancing the overall engagement and accessibility of the press release videos.\\

\textbf{Voiceover Generation}: For voiceover generation, the project utilizes the Deepgram API. However, it is noted that the Deepgram API struggles with non-English words, which may impact the quality of the audio in the videos. Despite this limitation, the API provides a valuable resource for generating voiceovers, adding an auditory dimension to the press release videos.\\

\textbf{Subtitling and Video Stitching}: Subtitling and video stitching are performed using the MoviePy library.
